<- Vertex ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Vertex class handles points in space.

An instance must be constructed from the points values as (the attributes between [] signs are optional : 
new Vertex( array('x' => 0 , 'y' => 0, 'z' => 0 [, 'w' => 0, 'color' => $Color]) );

X, Y, Z and W must be numeric values and can be floats as well or are set to 0 by default (W is set to 1.0). Negative are left as is.
$Color must be an instance of Color class as describe in Color.doc.txt (call doc method for more info). If not given or is not an instance of Color class, $color wille be set to white. 

The class provides the following methods :

Vertex   setX( $i );
set _X attribute $i value for current Vertex instance.

Vertex   setY( $i );
set _y attribute $i value for current Vertex instance.

Vertex   setZ( $i );
set _z attribute $i value for current Vertex instance.

Vertex   setW( $i );
set _w attribute $i value for current Vertex instance.

Vertex   setColor( $color );
set Color attribute value for current Vertex instance. $color must be an instance of Color class or left as is.

Vertex   getX( );
get _X attribute value for current Vertex instance.

Vertex   getY( );
get _y attribute value for current Vertex instance.

Vertex   getZ( );
get _z attribute value for current Vertex instance.

Vertex   getW( );
get _w attribute value for current Vertex instance.

Vertex   getColor( );
get Color attribute value for current Vertex instance.
